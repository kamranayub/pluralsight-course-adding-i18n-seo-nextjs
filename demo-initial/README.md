# Pluralsight Commerce Demo

This is the demo app from the course derived from [Next.js Commerce](https://github.com/vercel/commerce).

## Quick Start

- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for Mac/Linux or [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) for Windows

In this directory, open a terminal and run these commands:

```sh
# On Mac/Linux
nvm use
# On Windows
fnm use

# With Node and npm installed:
npm install
npm run dev
```

The Next.js dev server should launch on http://localhost:3000. The demo is self-contained and does not need Internet access.
